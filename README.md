# Hi, I'm Taya 👋  

🎓 Statistics & Data Science honours student | 🤖 Aspiring ML Engineer 

There is always something to learn and explore in the ever-evolving field of data science, machine learning and AI.
My GitHub is where I explore and upload end-to-end workflows that I work on: from data preprocessing → model building → evaluation → interpretability → deployment.

## 🔬 What I Do
- 🧮 Machine Learning
- 📊 Statistical Modeling  and Data Analysis 
- 🤖 Deep Learning 
- ⚙️ Tools: Python, R, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras,  Pandas, NumPy

## 📌 Featured Projects
Here are some of the projects I’ve been working on:

- [**Loan Default Prediction**](https://github.com/TA-777/loan-default-prediction)  
  Predicting loan default risk using Logistic Regression, KNN, Naïve Bayes, and ANN on an **imbalanced credit dataset**.  

- [**Rainfall Prediction (ML)**](https://github.com/TA-777/rainfall-prediction-ml)  
  Regression models for forecasting rainfall amounts, with a focus on feature engineering and time-series evaluation.  

- [**Survival Analysis (Biostats)**](https://github.com/TA-777/survival-analysis-biostats)  
  Ongoing 

- [**Uncertainty in Deep Learning**](https://github.com/TA-777/uncertainty-quantification-deep-learning)  
  Comparing Bayesian and dropout-based methods for predictive uncertainty in deep neural networks.
